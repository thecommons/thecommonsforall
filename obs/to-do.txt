   - use http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/

6. Add "inactive" attribute, but not to add person, only in edit person

7. Add "Next Discipleship State", and "Current Discipleship State"

     plus, out of band states:
     - Re-contact       (for those who have lapsed into inactive)

1. Mentor list on add-person page should be two drop-downs:
   a. state, which filters:
   b. person (based on roles which are eligible to be mentors for that state)
